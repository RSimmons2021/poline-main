Design a modern, artistically expressive React Native app inspired by the GitHub repo Poline, using the new components I provide.
The UI should feel like it was created by a fine artist, not a software engineer.

🎨 Global Art Direction

Overall Aesthetic:
Blend the artistic styles of Piet Mondrian, Wassily Kandinsky, and early Bauhaus graphic design.

Background Color:
Use a soft, warm beige (#f5f0e8 or similar) as the primary background across the entire app.

Stylistic Notes:

Strong geometric lines and structure (Bauhaus / Mondrian).

Playful circular motion, abstract shapes, and expressive compositions (Kandinsky).

Color as a living element — subtle animations, micro-interactions, and fluid transitions.

The UI should look like a high-end art magazine, not a typical mobile app.

Minimal text; let structure + shape + color do most of the communication.

Visual Traits:

Glassmorphic overlays with subtle frosted blur.

Thin but strong geometric dividers.

Soft shadows, crisp edges, high contrast with the beige base.

Dynamic color shifts on scroll or gestures.

📱 App Structure
Tabs: Explore • Painting • Interior • Library
🌈 Tab 1 — EXPLORE (Centerpiece: Generative Color Wheel)

Use the Generative Copic Color Wheel component (from the “Generative Color Wheel” folder) as the main visual anchor.

Layout

Full-screen wheel on the beige background.

Thin geometric lines radiating outward (à la Kandinsky) to frame content.

Subtle motion and breathing animation on idle.

Controls

Add a glassmorphic dropdown menu above or below the wheel:

“Wheel Style” Dropdown Options

Copic Wheel

Poline Wheel

Kandinsky Spiral

Mondrian Block Wheel

Bauhaus Grid Wheel

Random Mode

Other Requirements

Use the beige background as the global app background (all tabs).

The Explore tab defines the geometry of the entire visual language.

Integrate previous color palette generator behavior on tap/drag (Poline-driven).

🖼 Tab 2 — PAINTING (Full-Screen Generative Poster)

Use the Generative Poster component from your "Generative Poster" folder.

Layout

The entire background of the tab is the component (no margins).

Place minimal floating controls as small geometric glass blocks.

The poster evolves when the palette changes.

Allow save/share/export buttons on small floating geometry elements.

Inspiration

Think constructivist posters + Kandinsky abstract compositions.

Beige frames the art but recedes behind it.

🏠 Tab 3 — INTERIOR (Replace Component w/ Generative Harmonies)

Use the Generative Color Harmonies component as the full tab interface.

Requirements

Remove any existing interior-design component — replace it with this one.

The tab’s background should shift dynamically based on harmony colors (like the component does natively).

Shadowed geometric frames inspired by Mondrian to contain content or palette outputs.

Other Integrations

Continue using Poline to generate color sets.

Allow switching between:

Complementary

Analogous

Split

Triadic

Interior Trend Mode (warm minimalism, wabi sabi, brutalist, luxe)

📚 Tab 4 — LIBRARY (Dictionary of Color Combinations)

Integrate the “A Dictionary of Color Combinations” palette generator you already implemented.

Design Style

Beige Bauhaus background.

Thin vertical and horizontal lines reminiscent of Mondrian compositions.

Large grid-based color swatches that animate subtly.

Smooth scroll with micro-interactions when selecting a palette.

**🧩 Component Integration Requirements

Integrate all previous features from your older app into these new components:

Saved palettes

Export to PNG/JSON

“Tap to randomize”

Gesture-based color manipulation

Dynamic color transitions

Glassmorphic pop-up modals for settings and info

Poline-powered generative color logic throughout the app

🔥 Vibe / Emotional Tone

“An art studio disguised as an app.
A color tool disguised as a gallery.
A palette generator disguised as a magazine.”

The entire experience should feel like a creative instrument, not a utility.
